# Data Structures in JavaScript

In this sprint, I implemented, as part of a bootcamp, the following data structures in JavaScript:

- Stacks
- Queues
- Sets
- Map

### **Learning objectives**

- Fully understand the functional pattern of object creation in JavaScript, together with its pros and cons.
- Learn, throughout the sprint, about the rules of `this` in JavaScript.
- Comprehend the concept of `iterators` in JavaScript.
- Introduce yourself to data structures.

###  Important! 

- Each data structure **must** have it's own test file and be implemented using TDD.
- You must **not** use JavaScript arrays or any array methods or properties to implement your stack and queue structures. Everything should be implemented with _objects_ and custom methods.

### **TODO:**

- Linked List
- Trees
- Graphs
